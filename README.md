# Prodash

Prodash is a robust project management tool that enables team members to provide centralized updates. These updates are summarized using GPT and automatically dispatched to clients and managers via email. 

One of the key features of Prodash is the **Dashboard**, a real-time bubble map visualization that provides insights into team progress. This allows anyone with access to understand which teams are making the most progress at a glance.
